GitOps has revolutionized how we manage infrastructure, but security and compliance remain critical concerns.

## Security Considerations

### Supply Chain Security
- Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Use signed commits
- Implement code signing
- Verify container images

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access control
- Audit all changes

## Compliance Framework

### Policy as Code
- Define policies in version control
- Automate compliance checks
- Block non-compliant changes
- Regular policy reviews

### Audit Trail
- Immutable Git history
- Signed commits
- Change tracking
- Compliance reporting

## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with high-level policies
2. Implement progressive enforcement
3. Automate validation
4. Monitor and alert
