<Callout title="Guardrails" tone="warning">
Always keep the stable dashboard folder intact. Publish experimental panels into a shadow folder first.
</Callout>

<Steps title="Release path">
  <li>Create a new folder such as `dashboards/shadow` and sync it to staging only.</li>
  <li>Attach the same data sources as production but pin to canary namespaces.</li>
  <li>After validation, promote the folder and archive the previous release.</li>
</Steps>

Teams can safely add complex visualizations without losing historical parity. The same pattern works for alert rule experiments.
