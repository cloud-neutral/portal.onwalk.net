Live demos in this workshop stay close to how engineers actually deploy. Toggle environments, flip feature states, and observe how the rollout recipe responds in real time.

## What you will build

- A staged toggle flow that mirrors your GitOps pipelines.
- A small guardrail to ensure approvals stay attached to risky rollouts.
- A preview card that highlights the blast radius of each action.

Because the MDX runs through Contentlayer, interactive components compile at build time while preserving state on the client.
